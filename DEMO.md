# Demo of reproduced VALL-E X
### Original description from Microsoft
VALL-E X can synthesize personalized speech in another language for a monolingual speaker. Taking the phoneme sequences derived from the source and target text, and the source acoustic tokens derived from an audio codec model as prompts, VALL-E X is able to produce the acoustic tokens in the target language, which can be then decompressed to the target speech waveform. Thanks to its powerful in-context learning capabilities, VALL-E X does not require cross-lingual speech data of the same speakers for training and can perform various zero-shot cross-lingual speech generation tasks, such as cross-lingual text-to-speech synthesis and speech-to-speech translation.
